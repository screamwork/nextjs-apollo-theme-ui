## Manage file publication

Since one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking **File publication** in the **Publish** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove publication locations that are linked to your file.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.   
   
```js 
let pigs = 10;    
pigs = 2;    
console.log(pigs);     
```
